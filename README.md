Hi, it’s me again. *sissi*, your ***si**mple **s**tatic **si**tes* generator.

If you want to turn your simple React app into a static site with a built-in CMS look no further! Or actually, do: [the sissi-core repo][sissi-core] is where you'll find all you need. See you there!

## What sissi-cli can do for you

*sissi-cli* offers a few neat and simple commands for your sissi project:

- `sissi new` sets up a new project with the latest [sissi-core] version, including all the files you need
- `sissi dev` starts your website and the CMS in development mode
- `sissi start` builds your static site and runs the CMS

For further details please visit [sissi-core].
